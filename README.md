  Obsidian + PostgreSQL = ❤️
</h1>

<p align="center">
    An <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> plugin to upload your notes' metadata to your database.
</p>

## Features

-   send the Dataview annotations of a page to a PostgreSQL database
    -   this lets you use SQL queries on your data and integrate it with other tools, such as [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/README.md)

## Installation

1. Get a PostgreSQL database (see section below)
2. Set your PostgreSQL connection string inside the settings
3. Open the command panel and type "PostgreSQL" to see the list of available commands

### Setting up a PostgreSQL database

-   Follow [this guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to self-host PostgreSQL on your computer or a remote server.
-   You can also use a managed provider
    -   [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/rds/postgresql/resources/)
    -   [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/)
    -   [Managed PostgreSQL for Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/postgres)

I personally prefer to self-host PostgreSQL on an offshore server to protect my privacy. However, do note that it takes a bit more knowledge since if you host on a remote server, you will learn how to enable network encryption (SSL) to prevent unauthorized intermediaries from snooping on your data.

I did not try the managed providers that I listed above, but they are from reputable companies and provide way more storage and compute power than you will ever need to host the data generated by this plugin.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be, learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**!

### Development

1. Open this repository on Gitpod
2. Go to https://gitpod.io and copy your workspace SSH username and host inside `sync.sh`
3. Copy `sync.sh` inside `.obsidian/plugins`
4. Do some modifications on your remote Gitpod development instance
5. Execute `sync.sh` on your local computer (the plugin's files should get copied)
6. Iterate

### TODO

-   [x] overcomplicated development workflow
-   [x] set PostgreSQL URL in the settings
-   [ ] get various information from the current note
    -   [x] Dataview data
    -   [ ] list content
-   [ ] commands
    -   [x] upload current note
    -   [ ] bulk upload
    -   [ ] automatic upload on edit
-   [ ] submit to Obsidian plugin registry
